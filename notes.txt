It became very popular to go to a college in your state, but why? 


One reason was that there did not use to be colleges or universities nearby, and around the time of reconstruction there was funding and pushes to build those colleges so students from the midwest that used to make up large proportions of the eastern state colleges now had the option to go to college in their area. Similarly those from the mid south that were once in northern colleges and vice versa were not able to go to college anymore and had to return home, and they decided to continue to do so afterwards.


In uni of missouri they created a policy that if you were outside the state you paid double tuition (40$) but it ended up causing students to list missouri as their home state. Is this possibly what happened with why there are so many Tehuacanan students? they claimed that they lived there?

In some Georgia during the war, Wesleyans' room and board price was very high, so maybe that happened with trinity after the war. Students from out of state in the former confederacy probably did not have enough money to pay for the room and board, and its not like trinity had that much room in the first place, they were having students live in teacher homes.

No its not because after the war prices were realatively normal but they did not come, it seemed that people liked and prefered to continue to go to colleges nearby, like they had to during the war.
